def idea_separation(paper_contents: str) -> str:
    return f"""You are given raw text parsed from the PDF file which is either a
    book or a scientific paper. Your task is to help me to write a thesis, which
    may include this source as a reference.

    ## Instructions

    1. Read the whole paper and identify key ideas
    2. For each key idea you must write an ATOMIC, BUT SELF_CONTAINED idea, suitable for Zettelkasten system
    3. For each idea you must create a short and descriptive title which will be used as a file name, so avoid any special symbols
    4. Format the idea in a markdown format following the template below. Template contains single code block with markdown, you must follow contents of it, not including code block separators themselves
    5. Your explanation should be clear and easy to understand. If the paper provides an example, you may include it if it is relevant and helps with understanding
    6. Each idea should be separated from the others by 3 dashes on a new line `---`, like a usual page separator in markdown. Make sure to include separators before the first and after the last ideas as well
    7. DO NOT make notes with generally-known ideas. Like what NFT is and so on. Focus only on the ideas that paper provides as main ones
    8. If there are several related concepts you MUST create a Map Of Content (MOC) note linking all of them. For e.g. if there are several rules for making games mentioned you must create a note called "MOC - Title of the note" and inside it you should follow the same structure, but also provide a bullet-point list in body linking all the rules to that note. The format of the link should be just a usual markdown one: [[Note title]]. BUT DO NOT CREATE MAP OF CONTENT FOR THE PAPER ITSELF
    9. Double check and make super sure that all links are correct!
    10. If among your notes there are papers that are ideas that are related to one another, you can link them using format of links described earlier. But each link should be explained
    11. You must think very deeply before creating notes
    12. You MUST provide direct quote of the text mentioning information. The quote should be put under separate level 2 heading named Quote like "## Quote" in markdown
    13. NEVER EVER USE MARKDOWN CODEBLOCKS WHICH ARE SPECIFYIED USING ``` (three backticks symbols)

    ## Template

    ```markdown
    # <Note Name>

    > <gist of the idea in 1-2 sentences>

    ## Body

    <deep and full explanation of idea>
    ```

    ## Paper contents
    {paper_contents}
